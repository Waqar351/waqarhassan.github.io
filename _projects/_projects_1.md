## Overview
This project involves building a crime prediction system using Graph Neural Networks. It predicts crime hotspots in the city of SÃ£o Paulo.

### Key Features:
- **Graph-based** model using temporal crime data.
- **Interactive visualization** using Geospatial data.

### Technologies:
- PyTorch for machine learning
- NetworkX for graph processing
- Geospatial analysis for crime mapping
